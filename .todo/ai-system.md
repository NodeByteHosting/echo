# AI System Refactor & Modernization Checklist

## Architecture & Structure

- [x] Review and document the overall AI system architecture
- [x] Ensure all agents (conversation, support, research, knowledge, code) follow a consistent interface
- [x] Remove any legacy or unused agent/service files
- [x] Ensure all agent/service logic is modular and testable
- [x] Refactor agent/service code to use shared utility imports (`src/utils/index.js`)
- [x] Ensure all prompt usage is routed through the new prompt system

## Agent Improvements

- [x] Standardize error handling and logging in all agents
- [x] Remove duplicated logic between agents (e.g., context, cache, JSON handling)
- [x] Ensure all agents use the shared cache and JSON utilities
- [ ] Add or update tests for agent logic and edge cases
- [ ] Document each agent's responsibilities and configuration

## AI Model & Provider

- [x] Centralize AI model/provider configuration (OpenAI, etc.)
- [x] Ensure all AI calls use a consistent interface and error handling
- [ ] Add support for switching AI models via config or admin command
- [ ] Document how to add new AI providers or models

## Context & State Management

- [x] Standardize how context is built and passed between agents/services
- [x] Remove any redundant or legacy context-building code
- [x] Ensure all context-sensitive logic is tested and documented

## Performance & Monitoring

- [x] Review and optimize agent selection and routing logic
- [x] Ensure all performance metrics are collected and reported consistently
- [ ] Add or update monitoring for AI usage, errors, and cache stats
- [ ] Document performance best practices and tuning options

## Documentation

- [ ] Update or create architecture diagrams for the AI system
- [ ] Document agent/service interfaces and extension points
- [ ] Add migration notes for contributors regarding the new AI system structure

## General

- [x] Remove all dead code, legacy files, and unused exports
- [x] Ensure all code is formatted and linted
- [ ] Add or update integration and unit tests for the AI system
