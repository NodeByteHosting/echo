## Quick Start

1. Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    bun install
    ```

2. Configure environment:

    ```env
    DISCORD_TOKEN=your_bot_token
    OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key
    TAVILY_API_KEY=your_tavily_key
    DATABASE_URL=your_database_url
    ```

3. Initialize database:

    ```bash
    bunx prisma generate
    bunx prisma migrate dev
    ```

4. Start the bot:
    ```bash
    bun start
    ```

## Development

Start in development mode with hot reload:

```bash
bun dev
```

Format code:

```bash
bun run prettier --write .
```

## Architecture

### Core Components

-   **Discord Bot** - Built with discord.js for reliable interaction
-   **Database** - PostgreSQL with Prisma for type-safe queries
-   **AI System** - Multi-agent system for intelligent responses
-   **Event System** - Comprehensive event handling and logging

### Performance Features

-   **Rate Limiting** - Built-in rate limiting with per-user tracking
-   **Caching** - Efficient caching for frequently accessed data
-   **Load Balancing** - Smart distribution of AI processing
-   **Error Handling** - Comprehensive error handling with fallbacks

For detailed architecture information, see [docs/architecture.md](./docs/architecture.md).

## Performance Optimization

Echo has been optimized for maximum performance:

### Response Time Improvements

- **AI Response Caching** - Frequently asked questions are cached to reduce AI API calls
- **Smart Agent Selection** - Uses quick classification before full agent selection
- **Optimized Database Queries** - Efficient queries with appropriate indexes
- **Concurrent Operations** - Parallel processing of independent tasks
- **Token Optimization** - Dynamic allocation of token budgets based on query complexity

### Memory & Resource Usage

- **Memory Efficient Caching** - TTL-based caching with size limits
- **Background Processing** - Non-critical tasks run asynchronously
- **Smart Timeouts** - Prevent hanging on external service calls
- **Selective Context** - Only pass essential context data to reduce memory usage

### Configuration Tips

For optimal performance, configure the following in your `.env` file:

```env
# Increase or decrease based on your server resources
MAX_CONCURRENT_REQUESTS=3
RESPONSE_CACHE_SIZE=500
KNOWLEDGE_CACHE_TTL=1800
DB_POOL_SIZE=10
```

### Monitoring Performance

Use the built-in performance monitoring:

```bash
# View current performance metrics
/status

# For detailed metrics (admin only)
/system performance
```
