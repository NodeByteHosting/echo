# Echo — The Official Mascot of NodeByte Hosting

![Echo Banner](./assets/echo-banner.png)

**Echo** is our clever, tech-savvy fox mascot who represents the heart and soul of NodeByte Hosting. She’s here to make infrastructure feel a little more personal — from guiding users through dashboards, popping up in 404s, or keeping devs company in Discord.

> “Reliable, friendly, and always watching over your servers — meet Echo.”
